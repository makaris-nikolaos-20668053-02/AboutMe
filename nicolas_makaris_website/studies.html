                            Even though the direction I chose was the theoretical direction, the faculty and the department have managed to make me see subjects like marketing and management with a different eye. My initial goal was museology and to deal with museums and galleries a subject that the school confuses with librarianship.

                            This goal remains as I work as a tour guide at Roxane Matsa Estate (<a href="https://www.roxanematsaestate.com/">Read more about the estate here</a>).
                            As I mentioned above, the school provides various outlets and brings us into contact with various branches.
                            Courses that stood out for me in the 3 years of study are Art History and Modern and Modern European History, and marketing and communication were definitely the courses that give you the impetus to to discover in depth new disciplines and new knowledge.
