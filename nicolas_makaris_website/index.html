                            My name is Nikolas Makaris. I was born on June 5, 2002 in Athens. I am an outgoing person with various interests and opinions. Growing up in a closed society like that of Marathon it was hard to find myself and make friends and I was withdrawn for most of my life. When I finally went to school in Athens and got my own house, I also changed the page. Through my association with other people I started to learn about myself. Now as a different person I see life differently with colors and magic in every corner.                        </p>
